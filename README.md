# Global_Superstore_Sales_Data

###   This project was all about helping a global online store understand its business better by using its sales data. I started with a large, messy spreadsheet and cleaned everything up, which meant fixing errors and organizing the information so it made sense.  
###   Next, I used Power BI to create a visual and interactive dashboard. This wasn't just a basic reportâ€”it was a tool that let me explore the data and find out important things. I was able to see what products sold the most, which countries were bringing in the most profit, and even where the company was losing money.

###   In the end, I created a clear and easy-to-use report that helps anyone at the company quickly see how the business is doing. This project turned raw data into a simple story, allowing the business to make smarter choices based on what the numbers showed.
